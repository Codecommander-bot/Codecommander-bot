Enhancements and Additions:
Logging: Add a logging mechanism to track actions and state changes.
Goal Prioritization: Improve goal prioritization logic.
Emotion Influence: Enhance how emotions influence action selection.
Goal Persistence: Ensure goals are persisted and can be reloaded.
Detailed Feedback: Provide more detailed feedback on goal progress and state updates.
Here’s the improved code:

Conclusion
Your GoalModule has a strong foundation and well-defined functionality. The suggestions provided aim to enhance its flexibility, responsiveness, and user interaction. If you have specific features or scenarios you’d like to explore further, let me know! I’m here to help you continue developing your AGI system.# This workflow will build and push a node.js application to an Azure Web App when a commit is pushed to your default branch.
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target Azure App Service web app.
# For instructions see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-nodejs?tabs=linux&pivots=development-environment-cli
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Download the Publish Profile for your Azure Web App. You can download this file from the Overview page of your Web App in the Azure Portal.
#    For more information: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions?tabs=applevel#generate-deployment-credentials
#
# 2. Create a secret in your repository named AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE, paste the publish profile contents as the value of the secret.
#    For instructions on obtaining the publish profile see: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions#configure-the-github-secret
#
# 3. Change the value for the AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME. Optionally, change the AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH and NODE_VERSION environment variables below.
